# What makes a good Math Student?
I grew up in the Philippines where each grade level has 4-7 classrooms with at least 30 students in each class. I always wondered how classrooms were assigned to students. We all know if you are smart, you'll be part of class A or class 1, but how about the rest of the student body? How do they know?

This dataset only scatches the surface of one of my childhood questions and we have to start somewhere.
